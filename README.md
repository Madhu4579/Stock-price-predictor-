ðŸ“ˆ Project Overview
Objective: Predict future stock prices using historical data.
Scope: Focus on one or more companies; use daily closing prices.
Tech Stack: Python.

The user inputs historical stock prices as comma-separated values.

The program assigns each price to a day index and checks for valid input.
It manually calculates linear regression (slope and intercept) to find the trend.
Using this trend, it predicts prices for the next 5 days.
Finally, it displays the predicted prices in a clean, readable format.
